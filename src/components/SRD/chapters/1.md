# THE BASICS  

## Welcome to Fate!
If you’ve never played a roleplaying game before, here’s the basic idea: you and a bunch of friends get 
together to tell an interactive story about a group of characters you make up. You get to say what 
challenges and obstacles those characters face, how they respond, what they say and do, and what happens 
to them.

It’s not all just conversation, though—sometimes you’ll use dice and the rules in this book to bring 
uncertainty into the story and make things more exciting.

Fate doesn’t come with a default setting, [but it works best with any premise](#anchor-3) where the 
characters are proactive, capable people leading dramatic lives. We give more advice on how to bring that 
flavor to your games in the next chapter.

- - -

__NEW TO FATE__

If you’re a new player, all you really need to know is in this chapter and on your character sheet—the 
GM will help you figure out the rest. You may want to check out the [cheat sheet](#CHEAT-SHEET) just to 
save your GM some effort, but otherwise, you should be good to go.

If you’re a new GM, this is just the tip of the iceberg for you. You should read and get familiar with 
the whole book.

- - -

__FOR VETERANS__

You might be reading this because you’re familiar with Fate from our other games, Spirit of the Century 
and The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game. Several other popular RPGs, like Galileo Games’ Bulldogs! and 
Cubicle 7’s Legends of Anglerre, also use the Fate system.

This is a new version of Fate, which we developed to update and streamline the system. You’ll recognize 
some of what’s in here, but we’ve also changed some rules and some terminology. You can find a 
[guide to all the changes](#VETERANS-GUIDE) we’ve made near the end of the book.

## What You Need to Play  

Getting into a game of Fate is very simple. You need:

*   Between three and five people. One of you is going to be the gamemaster (or “GM” for short), and 
everyone else is going to be a player. We’ll explain what that means in a moment.  
    
*   A [__character sheet__](#blank-character-sheet), one per player, and some extra paper for note-taking. 
We’ll talk about what’s on the character sheet below. (GMs, any important characters you play might have 
a character sheet also.)  
    
*   Fate dice, at least four, preferably four per person. Fate dice are a special kind of six-sided dice 
that are marked on two sides with a plus symbol (+), two with a minus symbol (\-), and two sides are blank 
(0). You can get these dice from many hobby and game stores, often under their original name, Fudge dice. 
(For Fate’s purposes we’ll continue to call them Fate dice, but call them whatever you like!) Evil Hat 
will offer Fate dice for sale at [www.evilhat.com](http://www.evilhat.com/) later in 2013.  
    

     The Deck of Fate is an alternative to Fate dice that will be available from Evil Hat. It’s a deck 
of cards that mimics the probability of Fate dice, and is designed to be used in the same way Fate dice 
are.  

- - -

If you don’t want to use Fate dice, you don’t have to—any set of regular six-sided dice will work. If 
you’re using regular dice, you read 5 or 6 as +, 1 or 2 as \-, and 3 or 4 as 0.

- - -

*   Tokens to represent [__fate points__](#sigil_toc_id_15). Poker chips, glass beads, or anything similar 
will work. You’ll want to have at least thirty or more of these on hand, just to make sure you have 
enough for any given game. You can use pencil marks on your character sheet in lieu of tokens, but physical 
tokens add a little more fun.
*   Index cards. These are optional, but we find they’re very handy for recording [__aspects__](#sigil_toc_id_51) 
during play.

## Players and Gamemasters

In any game of Fate, you’re either a player or a gamemaster.

If you’re a player, your primary job is to take responsibility for portraying one of the protagonists of 
the game, which we call a player character (or “PC” for short). You make decisions for your character 
and describe to everyone else what your character says and does. You’ll also take care of the mechanical 
side of your character—rolling dice when it’s appropriate, choosing what abilities to use in a certain 
situation, and keeping track of fate points.

If you’re a gamemaster, your primary job is to take responsibility for the world the PCs inhabit. You 
make decisions and roll dice for every character in the game world who isn’t portrayed by a player—we 
call those non-player characters (or “NPCs”). You describe the environments and places the PCs go to 
during the game, and you create the scenarios and situations they interact with. You also act as a final 
arbiter of the rules, determining the outcome of the PCs’ decisions and how that impacts the story as 
it unfolds.

Both players and gamemasters also have a secondary job: make everyone around you look awesome. Fate is 
best as a collaborative endeavor, with everyone sharing ideas and looking for opportunities to make the 
events as entertaining as possible.

- - -

THE EXAMPLE GAME

All of our rules examples in this book refer to the same example game and setting. The name is Hearts 
of Steel, a tongue-in-cheek fantasy romp about a group of troubleshooters for hire. They traipse about 
the countryside and get into trouble at the behest of the various petty kings and fief lords who hire 
them.

The participants are Lenny, Lily, Ryan, and Amanda. Amanda is the GM. Lenny plays a thuggish swordsman 
named Landon. Lily plays the nimble, dashing, and dangerous Cynere, who also happens to love swords. 
Ryan plays Zird the Arcane, a wizard who, by contrast, has absolutely no love for swords.

Check out [_Game Creation_](#game-creation) to see how this game came about. We’ve included character 
sheets for the [example PCs](#LANDONS-CHARACTER-SHEET) at the end of the book.

- - -

## The Character Sheet

Players, your character sheet contains everything you need to know about your PC—abilities, personality, 
significant background elements, and any other resources that character has to use in the game. Here’s 
an example of a Fate character sheet, so we can show you all the components.

\[Insert your character sheet graphic here\]

### [Aspects](#Anchor-8)

Aspects are phrases that describe some significant detail about a character. They are the reasons why 
your character matters, why we’re interested in seeing your character in the game. Aspects can cover 
a wide range of elements, such as personality or descriptive traits, beliefs, relationships, issues 
and problems, or anything else that helps us invest in the character as a person, rather than just a 
collection of stats.

Aspects come into play in conjunction with fate points. When an aspect benefits you, you can spend fate 
points to [invoke](#Anchor-6) that aspect for a bonus. When your aspects complicate your character’s 
life, you gain fate points back—this is called accepting a [compel](#Anchor-7).

- - -

Lily’s character, Cynere, has the aspect Tempted by Shiny Things on her sheet, which describes her 
general tendency to overvalue material goods and make bad decisions when gems and coin are involved. 
This adds an interesting, fun element to the character that gets her into a great deal of trouble, 
bringing a lot of personality to the game.

- - -

Aspects can describe things that are beneficial or detrimental—in fact, the best aspects are both.

And aspects don’t just belong to characters; the environment your characters are in can have aspects 
attached to it as well.

### [Skills](#Anchor-12)

Skills are what you use during the game to do complicated or interesting actions with the dice. Each 
character has a number of skills that represent his or her basic capabilities, including things like 
perceptiveness, physical prowess, professional training, education, and other measures of ability.

At the beginning of the game, the player characters have skills rated in steps from Average (+1) to 
Great (+4). Higher is better, meaning that the character is more capable or succeeds more often when 
using that skill.

If for some reason you need to make a roll using a skill your character doesn’t have, you can always 
roll it at Mediocre (+0). There are a couple exceptions to this, like magic skills that most people 
don’t have at all. We’ll talk about skills in greater detail in their own chapter.

- - -

Zird the Arcane has the Lore skill at Great (+4), which makes him ideally suited to knowing a convenient, 
obscure fact and doing research. He does not have the Stealth skill, however, so when the game calls 
upon him to sneak up on someone (and Amanda will make sure it will), he’ll have to roll that at 
Mediocre (+0). Bad news for him.

- - -

### [Stunts](#Anchor-10)

Stunts are special tricks that your character knows that allow you to get an extra benefit out of a 
skill or alter some other game rule to work in your favor. Stunts are like special moves in a video 
game, letting you do something unique or distinctive compared to other characters. Two characters can 
have the same rating in a skill, but their stunts might give them vastly different benefits.

- - -

Landon has a stunt called Another Round? It gives him a bonus to get information from someone with 
his Rapport skill, provided that he is drinking with his target in a tavern.

- - -

### [Stress](#Anchor-9)

Stress is one of the two options you have to avoid losing a conflict—it represents temporary fatigue, 
getting winded, superficial injuries, and so on. You have a number of stress levels you can burn off 
to help keep you in a fight, and they reset at the end of a conflict, once you’ve had a moment to rest 
and catch your breath.

### [Consequences](#Anchor-11)

Consequences are the other option you have to stay in a conflict, but they have a more lasting impact. 
Every time you take a consequence, it puts a new aspect on your sheet describing your injuries. 
Unlike stress, you have to take time to recover from a consequence, and it’s stuck on your character 
sheet in the meantime, which leaves your character vulnerable to complications or others wishing to 
take advantage of your new weakness.

### [Refresh](#Anchor-13)

Refresh is the number of fate points you get at the start of every game session to spend for your 
character. Your total resets to this number unless you had more fate points at the end of the last 
session.

## Taking Action

Players, some of the things you’ll do in a Fate game require you to roll dice to see if your character 
succeeds or not. You will always roll the dice when you’re opposing another character with your 
efforts, or when there’s a significant obstacle in the way of your effort. Otherwise, just say what 
your character does and assume it happens.

To overcome an [obstacle](#Anchor-71)  

To create or unlock an advantage for your character, in the form of an [aspect you can use](#Anchor-47)

To attack someone in a [conflict](#Anchor-51)

To defend yourself in a [conflict](#Anchor-72)

  

### Rolling the Dice

When you need to roll dice in Fate, pick up four Fate dice and roll them. When you read the dice, 
read every + as +1, every 0 as 0, and every \- as –1. Add them all together. You’ll get a result 
from –4 to +4, most often between –2 and +2.

Here are some sample dice totals:

\-+0+ = +1  
+-00 =  
+++- = +2  
\-000 = −1  

The result on the dice isn’t your final total, however. If your character has a skill that’s 
appropriate to the action, you get to add your character’s rating in that skill to whatever you 
rolled.

So, once you’ve rolled the dice, how do you determine what a particular result means? Glad you asked.

## The Ladder  

In Fate, we use a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate the dice results, a character’s skills 
and the result of a roll.

Here’s the ladder:

+8

Legendary

+7

￼Epic

￼+6

Fantastic

+5

￼Superb

￼+4

Great

￼+3

Good

+2

￼Fair

￼+1

Average

￼0

Mediocre

\-1

￼Poor

￼-2

Terrible

  

It doesn’t really matter which side of the ladder you use—some people remember the words better, 
some people remember the numbers better, and some people like using both. So you could say, “I got 
a Great,” or “I got a +4,” and it means the same thing. As long as everyone understands what you’re 
communicating, you’re fine.

Results can go below and above the ladder. We encourage you to come up with your own names for 
results above Legendary, such as “Zounds!” and “Ridiculously Awesome.” We do.

### Interpreting Results

When you roll the dice, you’re trying to get a high enough roll to match or beat your opposition. 
That opposition is going to come in one of two forms: active opposition, from someone rolling dice 
against you, or passive opposition, from an obstacle that just has a set rating on the ladder for 
you to overcome. (GMs, you can also just decide your NPCs give passive opposition when you don’t 
want to roll dice for them.)

Generally speaking, if you beat your opposition on the ladder, you succeed at your [__action__](#Anchor-14). 
A tie creates some effect, but not to the extent your character was intending. If you win by a lot, 
something extra happens (like doing more harm to your opponent in a fight).

If you don’t beat the opposition, either you don’t succeed at your action, you succeed at a cost, 
or something else happens to complicate the [__outcome__](#Anchor-16). Some game actions have special 
results when you fail at the roll.

When you beat a roll or a set obstacle, the difference between your opposition and your result is what 
we call shifts. When you roll equal to the opposition, you have zero shifts. Roll one over your 
opposition, and you have one shift. Two over means two shifts, and so on. Later in the book, we’ll 
talk about different instances where getting shifts on a roll benefits you.

- - -

Landon is trying to escape an ancient mechanical death trap he accidentally set off during a “routine” 
exploration of the Anthari Catacombs. Dozens of tiny (and some not-so-tiny) spears are shooting out of 
the walls in a certain hallway, and he needs to get past them to the other side.

Amanda, the GM, says, “This is passive opposition, because it’s just a trap in your way. It’s opposing 
you at Great (+4). The Anthari really didn’t want anyone getting to their temple treasure.”

Lenny sighs and says, “Well, I’ve got Athletics at Good (+3), so I’ll try dodging and weaving through 
them to cross the hall.”

He takes up the dice and rolls, getting \-+++, for a result of +2. This steps up his result on the 
ladder by two, from Good (+3) to Superb (+5). That’s enough to beat the opposition by one shift and 
succeed.

Amanda says, “Well, it takes equal parts acrobatics and frantic stumbling, but you manage to make it 
through to the other side with only some cosmetic tears in your tunic to show for it. The mechanism 
shows no sign of stopping, though—you’ll still have to deal with it on your way out.”

Lenny replies, “Just another day at the office,” and Landon continues his trek through the catacombs.

- - -

## Fate Points  

You use tokens to represent how many fate points you have at any given time during play. Fate points 
are one of your most important resources in Fate—they’re a measure of how much influence you have to 
make the story go in your character’s favor.

You can spend fate points to invoke an aspect, to declare a story detail, or to activate certain 
powerful stunts.

You earn fate points by accepting a compel on one of your aspects.

A word of warning: don’t use edible things as tokens, especially if the food hasn’t arrived yet.

### Invoking an Aspect

Whenever you’re making a skill roll, and you’re in a situation where an 
[aspect might be able to help you](#Anchor-8), you can spend a fate point to invoke it in order to 
change the dice result. This allows you to either reroll the dice or add +2 to your roll, whichever 
is more helpful. (Typically, +2 is a good choice if you rolled –2 or higher, but sometimes you want 
to risk a reroll to get that +4.) You do this after you’ve rolled the dice—if you aren’t happy with 
your total.

You also have to explain or justify how the aspect is helpful in order to get the bonus—sometimes 
it’ll be self-evident, and sometimes it might require some creative narrating.

You can spend more than one fate point on a single roll, gaining another reroll or an additional +2, 
as long as each point you spend invokes a different aspect.

- - -

Cynere is trying to covertly goad a merchant into describing the security features of his personal 
vault by posing as a visiting dignitary. The merchant is giving her passive opposition at Good (+3), 
and her Deceive skill is Fair (+2).

Lily rolls. She breaks even, getting a 0. That leaves her result at Fair, not enough to get the 
information she wants.

She looks at her character sheet, then to Amanda, and says, “You know, long years of being Tempted by 
Shiny Things has taught me a thing or two about what’s in a treasure hoard and what’s not. I’m going 
to impress this merchant by talking about the rarest, most prized elements of his collection.”

Amanda grins and nods. Lily hands over a fate point to invoke the aspect, and gets to add +2 to her 
standing roll. This brings her result to a Great (+4), which exceeds the opposition. The duly impressed 
merchant starts to brag about his vault, and Cynere listens intently....

- - -

### Declaring a Story Detail  

Sometimes, you want to add a detail that works to your character’s advantage in a scene. For example, 
you might use this to narrate a convenient coincidence, like retroactively having the right supplies 
for a certain job (“Of course I brought that along!”), showing up at a dramatically appropriate moment, 
or suggesting that you and the NPC you just met have mutual clients in common.

To do this, you’ll spend a fate point. You should try to justify your story details by relating them 
to your aspects. GMs, you have the right to veto any suggestions that seem out of scope or ask the 
player to revise them, especially if the rest of the group isn’t buying into it.

Zird the Arcane gets captured with his friends by some tribesfolk from the Sagroth Wilds. The three 
heroes are unceremoniously dumped before the chieftain, and Amanda describes the chieftain addressing 
them in a strange, guttural tongue.

Ryan looks at his sheet and says, “Hey, I have If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About It on my 
sheet. Can I declare that I’ve studied this language at some point, so we can communicate?”

Amanda thinks that’s perfectly reasonable to assume. Ryan tosses over a fate point and describes 
Zird answering in the chieftain’s own speech, which turns all eyes in the village (including those 
of his friends) on him in a moment of surprise.

Ryan has Zird look at his friends and say, “Books. They’re good for you.”

- - -

### Compels

Sometimes (in fact, probably often), [you’ll find yourself in a situation where an aspect complicates](#Anchor-18) 
your character’s life and creates unexpected drama. When that happens, the GM will suggest a potential 
complication that might arise. This is called a compel.

Sometimes, a compel means your character automatically fails at some goal, or your character’s choices 
are restricted, or simply that unintended consequences cloud whatever your character does. You might 
negotiate back and forth on the details a little, to arrive at what would be most appropriate and dramatic 
in the moment.

Once you’ve agreed to accept the complication, you get a fate point for your troubles. If you want, you 
can pay a fate point to prevent the complication from happening, but we don’t recommend you do that very 
often—you’ll probably need that fate point later, and getting compelled brings drama (and hence, fun) 
into your game’s story.

Players, you’re going to call for a compel when you want there to be a complication in a decision you’ve 
just made, if it’s related to one of your aspects. GMs, you’re going to call for a compel when you make 
the world respond to the characters in a complicated or dramatic way.

Anyone at the table is free to suggest when a compel might be appropriate for any character (including 
their own). GMs, you have the final word on whether or not a compel is valid. And speak up if you see 
that a compel happened naturally as a result of play, but no fate points were awarded.

- - -

Landon has the aspect The Manners of a Goat. He is attending the annual Grand Ball in Ictherya with his 
friends, courtesy of the royal court.

Amanda tells the players, “As you’re milling about, a sharply dressed young lady catches Landon sticking 
out of the crowd. She observes him for a while, then goes to engage him in conversation, obviously 
intrigued by how different he looks among all the stuffy nobles.” She turns to Lenny. “What do you do?”

Lenny says, “Uh... well, I guess I’ll ask her to dance and play along, see what I can find out about her.”

Amanda holds up a fate point and says, “And is that going to go wrong, given Landon’s excellent command 
of courtly etiquette?”

Lenny chuckles and replies, “Yeah, I presume Landon will offend her pretty quickly, and that’ll get 
complicated. I’ll take the fate point.”

Amanda and Lenny play a bit to figure out just how Landon puts his foot in his mouth, and then Amanda 
describes some of the royal guard showing up. One of them says, “You might want to watch how you speak 
to the High Duchess of Ictherya, outlander.”

Lenny shakes his head. Amanda grins the grin of the devil.

## Start Playing!

These are the basic things you need to know to play Fate. The following chapters go into greater 
detail on everything we’ve covered above, and will show you how to get your game off the ground.

- - -

WHERE TO GO FROM HERE

*   The [_Game Creation_](#game-creation) chapter takes you through the process of setting up your 
game, so that should probably be your next stop. Then [_Character Creation_](#character-creation) 
will show you how to make the characters you’ll play.
*   Players, you’ll eventually want to read [_Actions and Outcomes_](#actions-and-outcomes) and 
[_The Long Game_](#THE-LONG-GAME), to help you get a better handle on the nuts and bolts of doing 
stuff and developing your character during play.
*   GMs, you’re going to want to familiarize yourselves with the whole book, but 
[_Running the Game_](#RUNNING-THE-GAME) and [_Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios_](#SCENES-SESSIONS-AND-SCENARIOS) 
are of particular importance to you.

# GAME CREATION  

## What Makes a Good Fate Game?

You can use Fate to tell stories in many different genres, with a variety of premises. There is no 
default setting; you and your group will make that up yourselves. The very best Fate games, however, 
have certain ideas in common with one another, which we think best showcase what the game is designed 
to do.

Whether you’re talking about fantasy, science fiction, superheroes, or gritty cop shows, Fate works 
best when you use it to tell stories about people who are proactive, competent, and dramatic.

### Proactivity

Characters in a game of Fate should be proactive. They have a variety of abilities that lend themselves 
to active problem solving, and they aren’t timid about using them. They don’t sit around waiting for 
the solution to a crisis to come to them—they go out and apply their energies, taking risks and overcoming 
obstacles to achieve their goals.

This doesn’t mean that they don’t ever plan or strategize, or that they’re all careless to a fault. 
It just means that even the most patient among them will eventually rise and take action in a tangible, 
demonstrable way.

Any Fate game you play should give a clear opportunity for the characters to be proactive in solving 
their problems, and have a variety of ways they might go about it. A game about librarians spending 
all their time among dusty tomes and learning things isn’t Fate. A game about librarians using forgotten 
knowledge to save the world is.

### Competence

Characters in a game of Fate are good at things. They aren’t bumbling fools who routinely look ridiculous 
when they’re trying to get things done—they’re highly skilled, talented, or trained individuals who 
are capable of making visible change in the world they inhabit. They are the right people for the job, 
and they get involved in a crisis because they have a good chance of being able to resolve it for the 
better.

This doesn’t mean they always succeed, or that their actions are without unintended consequence. It 
just means that when they fail, it isn’t because they made dumb mistakes or weren’t prepared for the risks.

Any Fate game that you play should treat the characters like competent people, worthy of the risks 
and challenges that come their way. A game about garbage men who are forced to fight supervillains 
and get their asses constantly handed to them isn’t Fate. A game about garbage men who become an awesome 
anti-supervillain hit squad is.

### Drama

Characters in a game of Fate lead dramatic lives. The stakes are always high for them, both in terms 
of what they have to deal with in their world, and what they’re dealing with in the six inches of space 
between their ears. Like us, they have interpersonal troubles and struggle with their issues, and though 
the external circumstances of their lives might be a lot bigger in scope than what we go through, we 
can still relate to and sympathize with them.

This doesn’t mean they spend all their time wallowing in misery and pain, or that everything in their 
lives is always a world-shaking crisis. It just means that their lives require them to make hard 
choices and live with the consequences—in other words, that they’re essentially human.

Any Fate game that you play should provide the potential and opportunity for drama among and between 
the characters, and give you a chance to relate to them as people. A game about adventurers mindlessly 
punching increasing numbers of bigger, badder bad guys is not Fate. A game about adventurers struggling 
to lead normal lives despite being destined to fight ultimate evil is.

  

- - -

__WHEN CREATING YOUR GAME:__

*   Setting: Decide what the world that surrounds the protagonists is like.
*   Scale: Decide how epic or personal your story will be.
*   Issues: Decide what threats and pressures inherent to the setting will spur the protagonists to action.
*   NPCs: Decide who the important people and locations are.
*   Skills and Stunts: Decide what sorts of things characters in the setting are likely to want to do.
*   Character Creation: Make the PCs.

- - -

## Setting Up Your Game

The first step in setting up your Fate game is to decide what sort of people the protagonists are and 
what sort of world surrounds them. Your decisions here will tell you virtually everything you need to 
know to get the ball rolling: what the protagonists are good at, what they may or may not care about, 
what problems they’re likely to get into, what kind of impact these characters have on the world, and 
so on. You don’t need complete answers (because that’s part of the point of playing the game), but you 
should have enough of an idea that answering those questions doesn’t draw a blank.

First, we’ll start by talking about your setting. We’ll handle the specifics on the protagonists later, 
in [_C_](https://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/Text/splash-3.xhtml#Anchor-19)_
[haracter Creation](#character-creation)_.

## Making the Setting Work in Fate

Decide what the world that surrounds the protagonists is like.

You’re probably already familiar with the idea of a setting, but in short, it’s everything that the 
characters interact with, such as people, organizations and institutions, technology, strange phenomena, 
and mysteries (crime, intrigue, and cosmic or historical legend). These are the sort of things that 
characters want to engage with, are forced to engage with, look to for help, or stand in their way.

If you’re using a setting that already exists, from a movie, novel, or other game book, then many of 
these ideas are ready for you to use. Of course, you’ll also likely add your own spin on things: new 
organizations or different mysteries to uncover.

If you’re inventing a setting, you have more work cut out for you. It’s beyond the scope of this chapter 
to tell you how to make a setting; we’re assuming you already know how to do that if that’s what you’re 
choosing to do. (Besides, we live in a vast world of media. See [tvtropes.org](http://tvtropes.org/) if 
you don’t believe us.) One word of advice, though—don’t try to invent too much up front. As you’ll see 
over the course of the chapter, you’re going to be generating a lot of ideas just through the process 
of game and character creation, so the details will come in time.

- - -

Amanda, Lenny, Lily, and Ryan sit down to talk about the setting. They’re all jonesing for a low fantasy 
game, as Lenny and Lily have recently read some of the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. So they pitch 
“two guys and a girl with swords.” The world is “vaguely medieval, Earth with the serial numbers filed off.”

Ryan suggests “guy and girl with swords, and guy without a sword” so that there’s a difference between 
the two guys. Also, because he wants to play someone who is more bookish (for contrast). Everyone’s on 
board with this, and they move on.

- - -

## A Game’s Scale

Decide how epic or personal your story will be.

The setting might be small or it might be vast, but where your stories take place determines the scale 
of your game.

In a small-scale game, characters deal with problems in a city or region, they don’t travel a great deal, 
and the problems are local. A large-scale game involves dealing with problems that affect a world, a 
civilization, or even a galaxy if the genre you’re playing in can handle that kind of thing. (Sometimes, a 
small-scale game will turn into a large-scale one over time, as you’ve probably seen in long-running novel 
series or television shows.)

Amanda likes the vibe of “guy and girl with sword,” and thinks it’ll shine as a small-scale game, where 
they might travel from town to town, but the problems they have to deal with are local—like a thieves’ 
guild or the regent’s vile machinations.

- - -

  

## The Setting’s Big Issues

Decide what threats and pressures inherent to the setting will spur the protagonists to action.

Every setting needs to have something going on that the characters care about, often a peril they want 
to fight or undermine. These are the setting’s issues.

You’ll come up with two issues as a group and write them down on index cards or a 
[game creation worksheet](#GAME-CREATION-WORKSHEET). These issues are aspects and will be available to 
invoke or compel throughout the entirety of the game.

The issues should reflect the scale of your game and what the characters will face. They’re broad ideas; 
they don’t just affect your characters, but many people in the world. Issues take two forms:

*   Current Issues: These are problems or threats that exist in the world already, possibly for a long time. 
Protagonists tackling these issues are trying to change the world, to make it a better place. Examples: a 
corrupt regime, organized crime, rampant poverty and disease, a generations-long war.
*   Impending Issues: These are things that have begun to rear their ugly heads, and threaten to make the 
world worse if they come to pass or achieve a goal. Protagonists tackling these issues are trying to keep 
the world from slipping into chaos or destruction. Examples: an invasion from a neighboring country, the 
sudden rising of a zombie horde, the imposition of martial law.

- - -

Game and character creation involve making aspects. If you’re new to Fate, read over the 
[_Aspects and Fate Points_](#ASPECTS-AND-FATE-POINTS) chapter.  

- - -

The default number of issues in a Fate game is two: Either two current issues (for a story solely about 
trying to make the world a better place), two impending issues (for a story about striving to save people 
from threats), or one of each. The latter option is common in fiction: think about the stalwart heroes 
who work against some impending doom while already discontent with the world around them.

- - -

__CHANGING THE NUMBER OF ISSUES__

Of course, you don’t have to use the default number of two issues if you don’t want to—one or three also 
works, but it will change the resulting game a bit. A game with one issue will revolve around just that 
issue—a quest to rid a city of evil, or to stop evil from happening. A game with three will show off a 
busy world, one where the characters’ resources are strained against multiple fronts. If you think you 
need to focus down or expand the scope of your game, talk it over with the group and start by tweaking 
the number of issues to best fit what you’re after.

- - -

The group thinks about the sort of problems they want to deal with in the world. Ryan immediately says 
“organized crime,” and they flesh that out a little. They come up with the idea of “The Scar Triad,” a 
group of thugs who are known for thievery, extortion, and other nasty things that the world could do 
without. This is clearly a current issue.

Lily wants the story to also be about something on the verge of happening, something Really Bad. They 
come up with an impending issue: a vile cult that seeks to summon something horrible into the world (which 
means they’re also saying that their setting includes horrible, Lovecraft-inspired things). Lenny calls 
it “The Doom that Is to Come,” and Ryan really likes this idea because it gives his bookish character a 
hook into things going on in the world.

- - -

### Making the Issues into Aspects

As we said earlier, issues are aspects. Turn the ideas you have into aspects that you could conceivably 
use at different times in the story (often as compels to the protagonists or as invocations for foes, 
but clever players will always find other uses for aspects). Write them down, and then if you need to 
add a little bit to remember the context or some details, write those down alongside the aspects.

- - -

Amanda writes down The Scar Triad and The Doom that Is to Come as two game aspects. She notes down 
next to The Scar Triad, “They’re into racketeering and other nasty stuff.” And with The Doom that Is 
to Come, “Led by the Cult of Tranquility.”

- - -

If you’re new to making aspects, hold off on this for now. You’ll get quite a bit of practice making 
aspects for your characters. Once you’re done with character creation, turn these issue ideas into aspects.

  

- - -

__CHANGING ISSUES IN PLAY__

[_The Long Game_](#THE-LONG-GAME) chapter will talk about this in detail, but issues can change as the 
game progresses. Sometimes, the issue evolves into something new. Sometimes, the characters will successfully 
fight against it, and it’ll be gone. And sometimes, new issues will emerge. So the ones you make are just 
what you’re starting off with.

- - -

  

### Drilling Down

You can also use issues to flesh out smaller, but nonetheless important pieces of your setting. An 
important location (a major city or nation, or even a memorable local restaurant) or organization (a 
knightly order, a king’s court, or a corporation) can have impending and/or current issues as well.

We recommend you start by giving only one issue to each setting element, just to keep things from getting 
too bogged down, but you can always add more as the campaign progresses. Likewise, you don’t have to do 
this right now—if you find a setting element becoming more important later in the game, you can give it 
issues then.

- - -

The Cult of Tranquility keeps popping up in pre-game discussions, so the group decides that it also 
needs an issue. After some discussion, the group decides it’d be interesting if there was some tension 
in the cult’s ranks, and makes a current issue called “Two Conflicting Prophecies”—different branches 
of the cult have different ideas of what the doom is going to be.

- - -

  

## Faces and Places

Decide who the important people and locations are.

At this point, you’ve probably got your issues figured out, and you may have thought of some organizations 
or groups that feature prominently in your game.

Now you have to put some faces on those issues and those groups, so that your PCs have people to interact 
with when they’re dealing with those elements. Do they have any particular people who represent them, 
or stand out as exemplars of what the issue’s referring to? If you have any ideas at this point, write 
them down on an index card: a name, a relationship to the organization or issue, and an aspect detailing 
their significance to the story.

Do the same for any notable places in your setting. Are there any important places where things happen, 
either important to the world, important to an issue, or important to the protagonists? If there’s a place 
where you envision multiple scenes taking place, then talk about that. Unlike NPCs, they don’t require aspects.

The GM may flesh these characters and places out later, depending on their [role in the story](#Anchor-25). 
Or one of these ideas might be a great inspiration for a protagonist! And, of course, new ones will unfold 
as the story progresses.

If there’s a piece of your setting that’s meant to be a [mystery](#Anchor-27) which the protagonists uncover, 
define it only in loose terms. The specifics can be detailed as they are revealed in play.

- - -

After a few minutes of discussion, the group writes down:

*   _Hugo the Charitable, a lieutenant in the Scar Triad. His aspect is Everyone in Riverton Fears Me._
*   _Which brings us to a place, the city of Riverton. There are two rivers here, so it’s a hub for trade._
*   _Amanda comes up with a sympathetic character, Kale Westal, who owns a shop in Riverton. She isn’t cowed by 
Hugo’s extortion, and will likely fall victim to an “accident.” Her aspect is Stubborn Because I’m Right._
*   _The Primarch, the leader of the Cult of Tranquility, whose identity is a mystery. Because that part of the 
setting is a mystery, they aren’t going to come up with an aspect or otherwise go any further, leaving those 
details to Amanda to figure out in secret._

They could go on, but they know they’ll have more ideas after character creation and as they play. That’s just 
enough to paint a picture of what’s going on at the very beginning of the story.

- - -

## Make Characters

Each player makes a protagonist.

You [can make player characters](#character-creation) after finishing game creation, or you can do it in the 
middle of this process—follow your instincts here. If you find yourself talking more about the characters than 
the world, go to character creation and then float back around to whatever parts of game creation you haven’t 
done yet. Otherwise, go ahead and finish out all of game creation first.

It’s worth noting that the protagonists should have some connections to the faces and places you named in the 
previous step. If it’s difficult to relate the characters to the setting, then you may want to rethink your 
protagonists or revise your game so it will make a better fit for the new characters.

When you’re making characters, you’ll also discover a bit more about the setting as people talk about who their 
characters know and what their characters do. If anything comes up that should be added to your game creation 
notes, do so before pushing forward with playing the game.

  

- - -

__SKILLS AND YOUR SETTING__

A big part of your setting is what people can do in it. The various skills in 
[_Skills and Stunts_](#skills-and-stunts) cover many situations, but you’ll want to look over them to see if 
any don’t apply or if there’s a skill you need to add.

Adding a skill is covered in more detail in the [_Extras_](#EXTRAS) chapter.

# CHARACTER CREATION  

## Character Creation Is Play

The moment you sit down to make the game and characters, you’re playing Fate. This style of character creation 
does three things to reinforce that.

First, character creation tells part of the characters’ stories, just like any other game session does.
 Characters that really come alive have histories of their own and with each other. This establishes where 
 they’ve been, what they’ve done, and why they continue to act against the issues they face, together or in 
 opposition. There’s an ongoing story you’re now stepping into—it’s just that the most interesting parts haven’t 
 happened yet.

Second, it sets the stage for the next part of the story. Each arc of a story sets up the next, so that they 
flow into one another in a natural evolution. Character creation needs to set up the [first story arc](#Anchor-30).

Third, character creation in Fate is collaborative. As with game creation, character creation is best done 
as a group activity. Doing all of this together builds a strong foundation of communication between the players 
and GM, and this process has a number of ways to establish connections between the characters and the setting.

Combined with game creation, character creation can take a full session to do—this allows everyone to learn 
about the world and each other’s characters. You and the other players will talk about your characters, make 
suggestions to each other, discuss how they connect, and establish more of the setting.

You’ll want to keep good notes on this process. You can use the character sheet and character creation worksheet 
in the back of this book or downloadable at [FateRPG.com](http://faterpg.com/).

Start by determining your [character’s high concept](#Anchor-31) and [trouble](#Anchor-32). Then build your 
character’s backstory, a process that takes place over three phases. Once you have that figured out, flesh out 
your character’s skills and stunts. Then you’re ready to play!

- - -

__WHEN CREATING YOUR CHARACTER:__

*   Aspects: Come up with your character’s high concept and trouble aspects.
*   Name: Name your character.
*   Phase One: Describe your character’s first adventure.
*   Phases Two and Three: Describe how you’ve crossed paths with two other characters.
*   Aspects: Write down one aspect for each of these three experiences.
*   Skills: Pick and rate your skills.
*   Stunts: Pick or invent three to five stunts.
*   Refresh: Determine how many fate points you start play with.
*   Stress and Consequences: Determine how much of a beating your character can take.

- - -

## Your Character Idea

Come up with your character’s high concept and trouble aspects.

Character creation starts with a concept for your character. It could be modeled after a character from a 
favorite novel or movie, or it could be based around some specific thing that you want to be able to do (like 
break boards with your head, turn into a wolf, blow things up, etc.). Just like you did with the game’s issues 
earlier, you’re going to take your ideas and turn them into the two central aspects for your 
character—[__high concept__](#Anchor-31) and [__trouble__](#Anchor-32).

Player characters should be exceptional and interesting. They could very easily find success in less exciting 
situations than those that come their way in play. You must figure out why your character is going to keep 
getting involved in these more dangerous things. If you don’t, the GM is under no obligation to go out of her 
way to make the game work for you—she’ll be too busy with other players who made characters that have a reason 
to participate.

- - -

__KEEP BUILDING YOUR SETTING__

As you’re making stuff up for your characters, you’ll also make stuff up about the world around them. You’ll 
end up talking about NPCs, organizations, places, things like that. That’s fantastic!

You might also come up with a character concept that adds something fundamental to the world, like saying 
“I want to play a wizard” when no one talked about magic yet. When that happens, discuss with the group if 
that’s a part of your setting and make any necessary adjustments.

- - -

Because picking a high concept and trouble are linked, they’re grouped together. You’ll likely have more 
success coming up with a compelling character idea if you think about them as one big step rather than two 
separate steps. Only after you have that (and a name, of course!) can you move on to the rest of character 
creation.

That said, don’t worry too much—if your character idea evolves later on, that’s great! You can always go 
back and tinker with the early decisions.

- - -

__DIALS, DIALS EVERYWHERE__

Fate Core isn’t the be-all and end-all of Fate. It’s just a starting point—a set of default decisions that 
will work if you use it as-is.

As you get more familiar with the system, you’ll be tempted to change things in order to suit your 
individual game or playstyle a little bit better. That’s totally okay. These defaults aren’t sacrosanct. 
We expect you to change them. In fact, throughout the book, we’re going to be pointing out where the dials 
are. The next book, the Fate System Toolkit, is all about how to change and configure the Fate system to meet 
your needs.

So, tweak away. We don’t mind.

- - -

### High Concept

Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about—who he is and what he does. It’s an 
aspect, one of the first and most important ones for your character.

Think of this [aspect like your job](#Anchor-8), your role in life, or your calling—it’s what you’re good 
at, but it’s also a duty you have to deal with, and it’s constantly filled with problems of its own. That is 
to say, it comes with some good and some bad. There are a few different directions you can take this:

*   You could take the idea of “like your job” literally: Lead Detective, Knight of the Round, Low-level Thug.
*   You could throw on an adjective or other descriptor to further define the idea: Despicable Regent of Riverton, 
Reluctant Lead Detective, Ambitious Low-level Thug.
*   You could mash two jobs or roles together that most people would find odd: Wizard Private Eye,Singing Knight 
of the Round Table, Monster\-slaying Accountant.
*   You could play off of an important relationship to your family or an organization you’re deeply involved 
with (especially if the family or organization are well-connected or well-known): Black Sheep of the Thompson 
Family, Low-level Thug for the Syndicate, Scar Triad’s Patsy in Riverton.

These aren’t the only ways to play with your high concept, but they’ll get you started. But don’t stress out 
over it—the worst thing you can do is make it into too big of a deal. You’ll come up with four other aspects 
after this one—you don’t have to get it all nailed right now.

- - -

__IF YOU GET STUMPED ON ASPECTS__

The golden rule of making aspects in character creation: you can always change it later. If you’re struggling 
to make an aspect, write out the idea in as many words as you need to, in order to get it down on paper in the 
first place. If a specific phrase pops up after you write it down, great! If not, maybe someone else at the 
table can help you come up with an aspect. And if you’re still stuck, leave it for now—you’ll have plenty of 
time during play to refine it.

And if you really need to, it’s okay to leave some blank. Look at [Quick Character Creation](#Anchor-35) for 
more on leaving parts of your character sheet blank.

- - -

High concepts can have overlap among the characters, as long as you have something to distinguish how your 
character is different from the others. If high concepts must be similar among all the characters, such as 
if the GM pitches an all-swordsmen story, it’s crucial that the [troubles](#Anchor-32) differ.

- - -

Lenny and Lily settled on the “guy and girl with sword” idea, and Ryan’s going with “guy without sword.” But 
those are just starting ideas. Now it’s time to turn them into proper high concepts.

Lenny latches onto the idea of tying his concept to an organization, and starts with “Disciple of…something.” 
He envisions a character who has trained in some mysterious martial art, and that involves rival schools and 
foes that want to learn those secrets. The group helps him come up with a suitably mysterious name: Disciple 
of the Ivory Shroud. (And now we’ve made a bit more setting: there’s an Ivory Shroud, mysterious martial arts,
 and all that implies.)

Lily, on the other hand, doesn’t really know where to go from “girl with sword.” She’s not interested in the 
organization thing, so she’s thinking about adjectives. Eventually, she settles on Infamous Girl with Sword. 
(Keeping the “girl with sword” part makes her giggle, so she wants to say it often during the game.)

Ryan’s idea of “bookish guy without sword” would be a pretty dull aspect. He thinks about what’s been declared 
so far: an evil cult who can summon Bad Things and a mysterious martial arts school. So he asks “hey, can I be 
a wizard?” They talk a bit about what that means, so that being a wizard doesn’t overshadow the swordsmen and 
isn’t a weak idea. After that, he writes down Wizard for Hire.

- - -

### Trouble

In addition to a high concept, every character has some sort of trouble aspect that’s a part of his life and 
story. If your high concept is what or who your character is, your trouble is the answer to a simple question: 
what complicates your character’s existence?

Trouble brings chaos into a character’s life and drives him into interesting situations. Trouble aspects are 
broken up into two types: personal struggles and problematic relationships.

*   Personal struggles are about your darker side or impulses that are hard to control. If it’s something 
that your character might be tempted to do or unconsciously do at the worst possible moment, it’s this sort 
of trouble. Examples: Anger Management Issues, Sucker for a Pretty Face,The Bottle Calls to Me.
*   Problematic relationships are about people or organizations that make your life hard. It could be a group 
of people who hate your guts and want you to suffer, folks you work for that don’t make your job easy, or even 
your family or friends that too often get caught in the crossfire. Examples:Family Man, Debt to the Mob, The 
Scar Triad Wants Me Dead.

Your trouble shouldn’t be easy to solve. If it was, your character would have done that already, and that’s 
not interesting. But nor should it paralyze the character completely. If the trouble is constantly 
interfering with the character’s day-to-day life, he’s going to spend all his time dealing with it rather 
than other matters at hand. You shouldn’t have to deal with your trouble at every turn—unless that’s the 
core of one particular adventure in the story (and even then, that’s just one adventure).

Troubles also shouldn’t be directly related to your high concept—if you have Lead Detective, saying your 
trouble is The Criminal Underworld Hates Me is a dull trouble, because we already assume that with your 
high concept. (Of course, you can turn that up a notch to make it personal, like Don Giovanni Personally 
Hates Me, to make it work.)

Before you go any further, talk with the GM about your character’s trouble. Make sure you’re both on the 
same page in terms of what it means. Both of you may want to find one way this aspect might be invoked or 
compelled to make sure you’re both seeing the same things—or to give each other ideas. The GM should come 
away from this conversation knowing what you want out of your trouble.

  

- - -

Lenny wants to contrast the whole “I know an ancient martial art” vibe. He’s not playing an ascetic monk 
or anything like that. So he wants something that will get him into social trouble, something that has 
to do with him and not with any specific people or organizations. So he writes down The Manners of a 
Goat. His character will unconsciously make an ass of himself.

Lily likes this idea of her character being her own worst enemy, so she’s also going for a personal 
struggle. She’s had the idea for a while of playing someone who can’t help but be Tempted by Shiny 
Things, so she writes that down.

After seeing the other two go for personal struggles, Ryan wants to add a bit to the setting by having 
a problematic relationship trouble. He wants something that’s involved with his high concept, someone 
he can’t just fight openly against—he wants to see intrigue in his story. So he writes downRivals in the 
Collegia Arcana (which also names a group of people in the setting, that Ryan’s character is a part of).

- - -

__THE “BRIGHT” SIDE OF TROUBLES__

Since your trouble is an aspect, it’s something you should also be able to [invoke](#Anchor-36), right? 
Because we’ve been so focused on how this complicates your character’s life, it’s easy to miss how a 
trouble also helps your character.

In short, your experience with your trouble makes you a stronger person in that regard. Dealing with 
personal struggles leaves you vulnerable to being tempted or cajoled, but it can also give you a sense 
of inner strength, because you know the sort of person you want to be. Problematic relationships often 
cause trouble, but people do learn hard lessons from the troubles they deal with. They especially learn 
how to maneuver around many of the smaller issues their troubles present.

Lenny’s The Manners of a Goat could be used to the group’s benefit. Maybe he turns that up intentionally, 
to draw attention away from Lily’s character sneaking around.

With Lily’s Tempted by Shiny Things, we could reasonably say that Lily’s character is well-acquainted 
with the value of various shiny things (and well-acquainted with getting caught and locked in prison, 
so she knows a thing or two about escaping).

Ryan’s Rivals in the Collegia Arcana can come in handy when dealing with rivals he knows well—he knows 
what to expect from their tactics. He could also use this aspect to gain aid from people who share his 
rivals.

- - -

__INTRO TO CHOOSING ASPECTS__

A lot of character creation focuses on coming up with aspects—some are called high concepts, some are 
called troubles, but they basically all work the same way. Aspects are one of the most important parts 
of your character, since they define who she is, and they provide ways for you to generate fate points 
and to spend those fate points on bonuses. If you have time, you really might want to read the whole 
chapter we have dedicated to aspects before you go through the process of character creation.

In case you’re pressed for time, here are some guidelines for choosing aspects.

Aspects which don’t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you need it and by drawing 
you into danger and action when the story needs it) aren’t doing their job. The aspects which push you 
into conflict—and help you excel once you’re there—will be among your best and most-used.

Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous—allowing you to help shape the story and generating lots 
of fate points—and they should never be boring. The best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways 
it can complicate your situation. Aspects that cannot be used for either of those are likely to be 
dull indeed.

Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, maximize their interest.

When you’re told you need to come up with an aspect, you might experience brain freeze. If you feel 
stumped for decent ideas for aspects, there’s a big section focusing on several methods for coming 
up with good aspect ideas in [_Aspects and Fate Points_](#ASPECTS-AND-FATE-POINTS).

If your character doesn’t have many connections to the other characters, talk with the group about 
aspects that might tie your character in with theirs. This is the explicit purpose of [Phases Two](#Anchor-37) 
and [Three](#Anchor-38)—but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it elsewhere as well.

If you ultimately can’t break the block by any means, don’t force it—leave it completely blank. You 
can always come back and fill out that aspect later, or let it develop during play—as with the 
[Quick Character Creation](#Anchor-35) rules.

Ultimately, it’s much better to leave an aspect slot blank than to pick one that isn’t inspiring 
and evocative to play. If you’re picking aspects you’re not invested in, they’ll end up being 
noticeable drags on your fun.

- - -

### Name

If you haven’t already, it’s time to give your character a name!

- - -

Lenny names his character “Landon,” a name that’s been in his head for years. He used it years ago 
for another roleplaying game, and decides to bring it back for nostalgia’s sake.

Lily names her character “Cynere,” which is Greek for “thistle.” She sees Cynere as a beautiful 
plant, but one that’ll prick you if you get too close. That fits nicely.

Ryan names his character “Zird,” because it just hit his mind as an appropriately ridiculous 
wizardly name. Then he pauses for a moment before adding “…the Arcane,” because he sees Zird as 
the sort of guy who would demand to be known as “Zird the Arcane.”

- - -

## The Phase Trio

Describe your character’s first adventure. Describe how you’ve crossed paths with two other 
characters. Write down one aspect for each of these three experiences.

Important: Before moving on to this step, you need to have figured out your high concept, 
trouble, and name.

The three remaining aspects on your character are made in phases, together called the phase 
trio. The first phase is about recent background: something you did that’s interesting and 
adventurous. The second and third are about how the other player characters got involved in that 
adventure, and how you got involved in theirs.

This is an opportunity to tell a story about your characters. Each phase will ask you to write 
down two things. Use the [character creation worksheet](#CHARACTER-CREATION-WORKSHEET) (at the back 
of this book, or at [FateRPG.com](http://faterpg.com/)) to write down those details.

*   First, write a summary of what happened in that phase. A couple of sentences to a paragraph 
should suffice—you don’t want to establish too much detail up front, because you might have to adjust 
details in later phases.
*   Second, write an aspect that reflects some part of that phase. The aspect can cover the general 
vibe from the summary, or it can focus on some piece of it that still resonates with your character 
in the present day.

noticeable drags on your fun.

- - -

### Phase One: Your Adventure

The first phase is your character’s first true adventure—his first book, episode, case, movie, 
whatever—starring him.

You need to think up and write down the basic details of this story for the phase’s summary. 
The story doesn’t need to have a lot of detail—in fact, a pair of sentences works pretty 
well—because your fellow players will add in their own details to this past adventure in the 
next two phases (as you will to theirs).

If you find yourself stuck, look to your character’s high concept and trouble. Find a dilemma 
that has a chance of throwing those ideas into focus. What problem do you get roped into because 
of your high concept or trouble? How does the other aspect help or complicate your life?

Ask yourself the following story questions. If you have trouble answering them, talk to the 
other players and the GM for help.

*   Something bad happened. What was it? Did it happen to you, to someone you cared about, 
or to someone that you were coerced into helping?
*   What did you decide to do about the problem? What goal did you pursue?
*   Who stood against you? Did you expect the opposition you got? Did some of it come out of nowhere?
*   Did you win? Did you lose? Either way, what consequences arose from the outcome?

Once you’ve come up with the adventure, write an aspect that relates to some part of what happened.

A note on timing: Because two other characters will be involved in the following phases, this 
adventure needs to be something that isn’t so early in your character’s life that he hasn’t met 
the other protagonists yet. If one of you has decided that you recently showed up in the story, 
then the adventures involving that person happened recently. If some of you have been friends 
(or old rivals!) for a long time, then those adventures can take place further in the past. 
Your best bet is to not make these adventures specific in time; you can figure out that part 
once you know who’s involved in your story.

Lenny goes through Phase One. He looks at the story questions to help him figure out the events 
of the phase, and decides on the following:

The bad thing was that Landon kept getting into scrapes at his local tavern. He grew up with 
no sense of discipline or demeanor and constantly picked fights with people larger and 
stronger than him.

One thug Landon insulted at the tavern was connected to the Scar Triad, so some of the thug’s 
bandit buddies showed up and beat Landon to within an inch of his life.

His bleeding body was then found by a veteran soldier named Finn who healed Landon’s wounds 
and encouraged him to join the town militia where he could learn some discipline and fight 
with honor.

Now Lenny has to write down an aspect related to this story. He decides to take I Owe Old 
Finn Everything as his aspect, because he wants to keep the connection to Finn in his story 
and give Amanda a cool NPC to play.

__PHASES AND INDEX CARDS__  

In phase one, you each came up with your own adventure. In phases two and three, you’re 
going to trade those stories around as other players’ characters get involved. Figuring 
out how your character fits into someone else’s story can be hard to do if you’ve handed 
your character phase worksheet to another player, so we recommend that you use index cards 
(or whatever scraps of paper you have).

During the first phase—when you’re writing your adventure down on your worksheet—take a 
card and write your character’s name and adventure description. Then you’ll pass the card 
around during the second and third phases so people can contribute to your story. That 
way, you’ll still have your worksheet when you’re writing your contributions and aspects, 
and other people will know what stories they’re supposed to hook into.

- - -

As with the high concept and trouble aspects, this (and the following phases) are further 
opportunities to flesh out the setting.

### Phase Two: Crossing Paths

In the next two phases, you’ll tie the group together by having other characters contribute 
a minor, supporting role in your adventure, and vice versa.

Once everyone has their adventure written down (which is where our index card suggestion 
comes in really handy), you’re ready for phase two. You can pass to the left or right, or 
shuffle the stack and hand them out randomly (trading with the person to your right until 
you each have one that isn’t yours). However you decide to do it, every player should now 
be holding someone else’s adventure.

Your character has a supporting role in the story you’re holding, which you get to come 
up with right now. Briefly discuss it with the player whose adventure it is and add a 
sentence or phrase to the summary to reflect your character’s supporting role. Supporting 
roles come in three forms: they complicate the adventure, solve a situation, or both.

*   Complicating the adventure: Your character managed to make some part of the adventure 
uncertain (possibly because of an issue or trouble aspect). Of course, since that happened 
in the past, we know you got out of it all right (or mostly all right, as indicated by the 
aspect you take). When describing this, don’t worry about how the situation is resolved—leave 
that for someone else, or leave it open. Descriptions like “Landon starts trouble when Cynere 
needs him quiet” or “Zird gets captured by mysterious brigands” are enough to get some ideas 
flowing.
*   Solving a situation: Your character somehow solves a complication that the main character 
in the adventure had to deal with, or your character aids the main character in the central 
conflict (which is an opportunity to involve your high concept aspect). When describing this, 
you don’t have to mention how the situation was created, just how your character takes care 
of it. Descriptions like “Cynere holds off foes to give Landon time to escape” or “Zird uses 
his arcane knowledge to ask the ghosts for information” are enough to give us an idea of what 
happens.
*   Complicating and solving: Here, your character either solves one situation but creates 
another, or creates a situation but later solves a different one. Mash up the two ideas, using 
the word “later” in between them, such as: “Landon starts a fight with the Scar Triad while 
Zird is trying to lay low. Later, he helps Zird by fighting off undead while Zird’s casting 
a spell.”

- - -

The default phase trio prioritizes connecting the characters together in a shared backstory. 
We like this, because it’s cooperative and gets you talking to one another. That’s not the only 
way to do it, though. You could make any significant trifecta of backstory details into a 
phase trio. Your past, your present, and your hope for the future is another set of trio elements. 
The Fate System Toolkit has more examples of phase work.

- - -

The idea is to be a bit self-serving here. You want to put a little spotlight on your character 
in order to figure out a good aspect from it: something you’re known for, something you can do, 
something you own or have, and someone you have a relationship with (for good or ill).

Finally, write the adventure idea and your character’s contribution down on your phase 
worksheet. This is important, because your character gets an aspect from the supporting role 
he played. The person whose adventure it is should also write down the contribution, if 
there’s room on his sheet.

- - -

Lily has Landon’s starting adventure and needs to decide how she fits into it.

She decides that Cynere helped solve the situation. After Landon ends up in the militia, he 
still has a grudge against the Triad members who ganged up on him. In fact, they robbed him of 
his heirloom sword in the process. Hearing Landon’s tale of woe, Cynere agrees to help steal 
the sword back.

She takes the aspect A Sucker for a Sob Story, to reflect the reason why she got involved.

- - -

Landon gets into a bar fight with some of the Scar Triad. He is robbed of his sword and beaten 
severely. His life is saved by a veteran soldier named Old Finn. Finn helps to heal Landon, 
clean him up, and enlist him in the town militia.

When Landon tells Cynere his story, she takes pity on him and decides to help him recover his lost sword.

### Phase Three: Crossing Paths Again

Once everyone’s done with phase two, you’ll trade adventures with whatever method you chose before, 
so long as everyone has an adventure that isn’t theirs or the one they just contributed to. Then 
you’re ready for phase three, where you’ll contribute to this second adventure and determine your 
next aspect. Follow the directions from phase two.

- - -

Lily gets Zird’s starting adventure, a pretty straightforward romp where Zird battles his Collegia 
rivals to obtain a magical artifact and return it to its rightful place.

She decides that she complicates that situation, by wanting the shiny artifact for herself. Ryan 
already established that Zird gets the artifact back to where it belongs, so she only holds it 
temporarily.

She decides to take I’ve Got Zird’s Back, as a way of reflecting her willingness to stick her 
neck out for Zird—the group doesn’t know what he did to earn such loyalty, but they figure they’ll 
find out eventually.

- - -

And with that, you have your five aspects and a good chunk of background!

- - -

__FEWER THAN THREE PLAYERS?__

The phase trio assumes that you’ll have at least three players. If you have only two, consider 
the following ideas:

*   Skip phase three and just make up another aspect, either now or in play.
*   Come up with a third, joint-story together, and write about how you each feature in that one.
*   Have the GM also make a character. The GM won’t actually play this character alongside the 
PCs, though—it should just be an NPC. Such an NPC can be a great vehicle for kicking off a 
campaign—if a friend they’re tied to during character creation mysteriously disappears or even 
dies, that’s instant fuel for drama.

- - -

If you only have one player, skip phases two and three, leaving the aspects blank to be filled 
in during play.

Cynere steals Zird’s artifact. Eventually it returns to Zird’s hands and the two gain a mutual 
respect for each other.

## Skills

Pick and rate your character’s skills.

Once you have mapped out your character’s phases and chosen aspects, it’s time to pick skills. 
You’ll find descriptions and details for each skill in the [_Skills and Stunts_](#skills-and-stunts) chapter.

Your skills form a pyramid, with a single skill rated at Great (+4)—which we’ll usually refer 
to as the peak skill—and more skills at each lower rating on the ladder going down to Average (+1):

*   One Great (+4) skill
*   Two Good (+3) skills
*   Three Fair (+2) skills
*   Four Average (+1) skills

- - -

__FOR VETERANS: WHY THE PYRAMID?__

If you’ve played The Dresden Files RPG, you know that we use skill columns for that instead 
of the pyramid.

In this build of Fate, we wanted character creation to be as quick and accessible as possible, 
so we went with the pyramid as standard. If you want to use the columns, go ahead—you get 20 
skill points.

Skill columns didn’t completely go away. It’s just [reserved for advancement](#Anchor-40).

- - -

__THE SKILL CAP__

By default, we make Great (+4) the highest rated skill PCs start with. As characters advance, 
they can improve beyond this cap, but it’s more difficult than improving skills rated below 
the cap (see [Major Milestones](#Anchor-55)).

If you’re making a game about superheroes, pandimensional creatures, mythic gods or other 
beyond-human characters, feel free to set the tip of the skill pyramid—and thus the cap—at 
Superb (+5) or Fantastic (+6).

The number of skills you get should be relative to the size of the skill list. Our default 
skill list has 18 skills, and the Great pyramid gives you a rating in 10 of them, which means 
every character has some capability in over half of the total number of things you can do, 
and there’s room for six PCs to peak (as in, to choose their three top skills) without overlap. 
You can tweak this for individual games, especially if you adjust the skill cap. Just keep in 
mind that bigger pyramids mean more overlap between characters, unless your game has a longer 
skill list.

- - -

Mediocre (+0) is the default for any skill you do not take. Sometimes, a skill will state 
that it’s unavailable if a character didn’t take it; in those cases, it’s not even at Mediocre.

- - -

Ryan knows that Zird’s not like the other PCs in terms of skills, so he looks to distance 
Zird from them as much as possible. The group has decided that Zird’s magic is going to work 
off his Lore skill, so he’s naturally going to focus on that.

He takes Lore as Zird’s peak skill, followed by Crafts and Rapport—for a wizard, Zird considers 
himself a fairly social sort. Ryan takes Athletics, Will, and Investigate because he figures 
Zird will need them in his line of work, and a smattering of other skills either because neither 
of his friends have them, or because he wants a positive score in them when everyone’s separated. 
That ends up being Fight, Resources, Contacts, and Notice.

- - -

Note: a few skills have special benefits, notably those skills that affect the number of 
[stress boxes and consequences](#Anchor-41) you have available. If you know you want a certain 
number of those, put those skills on the pyramid first.

## Stunts and Refresh  

Pick or invent three to five stunts. Determine how many fate points you start play with.

Stunts change how skills work for your character. Picking and inventing stunts are covered in 
the [Skills and Stunts](#skills-and-stunts) chapter.

You get three stunts for free, and you can take up to two more stunts at the cost of lowering 
your refresh by one each. (The gist is this: the more cool tricks you can do, the more you’ll 
need to accept compels to get fate points.) Figuring out stunts can take a while, so you may 
want to pick one for now and [determine the rest of them during play](#Anchor-62).

- - -

Lily decides to take the Warmaster stunt as one of her freebies: +2 to Fight rolls made to create 
an advantage against an opponent, provided the opponent has a fighting style or weakness she can 
exploit.

For her remaining free stunts, she picks Second-Story Girl and Danger Sense. You can see the 
write-ups for these on her [character sheet](#CYNERES-CHARACTER-SHEET).

- - -

### Adjusting Refresh

A player character in Fate starts with a refresh of 3. That means he’ll start each session off 
with at least [3 fate points](#Anchor-42).

If you pick four stunts, your refresh is 2. If you pick five stunts, your refresh is 1.

Note: some Fate games will change this setup. Regardless of how stunts work in your game, you 
can never have a refresh lower than 1.

- - -

You can adjust these defaults if you want to, and give out more free stunts if you want the 
PCs to have a lot of cool tricks and special bonuses. You can also change the default refresh 
rate—higher refresh means that the PCs won’t need to take compels as often (think 4-color 
superhero comics), and lower refresh means they’ll need to take several early in every session 
in order to have a decent supply (think Die Hard). Also, the higher your refresh, the more 
likely it is that players will buy stunts.

- - -

## Stress and Consequences

Determine how much of a beating your character can take.

When Fate characters find themselves in harm’s way—a fairly common occurrence when you’re 
highly competent, proactive, and facing drama at every turn—they have two ways to stand their 
ground and stay on their feet: stress and consequences.

The [Conflicts](#Anchor-44) section of the Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts chapter fully 
explains what these mean and how they’re used. In brief, stress represents the ephemeral toll 
of participating in a conflict, whereas consequences are the lingering effects, and sometimes 
quite traumatic ones, of taking harm.

Every PC has two different [__stress tracks__](#Anchor-9). The physical stress track deals with 
physical harm, and themental stress track mitigates mental harm. The more boxes in a stress track, 
the more resilient the character is in that regard. By default, a character has two boxes in each 
stress track.

Every PC also has three  [__consequence slots__](#Anchor-11). One is mild, one is moderate, and 
the last one is severe. Unlike stress, these aren’t classified as either physical or mental—any 
of them can apply to any type of harm. As mentioned above, consequences are the injuries and 
traumas you can’t just shake off after the dust settles.

Certain skills and some stunts can add to these defaults. See the [_Skills and Stunts_](#skills-and-stunts) 
chapter for more on that. For the sake of quick reference, these are the skills in Hearts of Steel 
that alter stress and consequences:

Physique helps with physical stress, and Will helps with mental stress. Either skill grants one 
more stress box of the respective type (physical or mental) if rated at Average (+1) or Fair (+2), 
or two more stress boxes if rated at Good (+3) or higher. At Superb (+5) or higher, they also 
grant an additional mild consequence slot. Unlike the standard three, this consequence slot is 
specifically restricted to either physical harm (Physique) or mental harm (Will).

Note: if you’re playing in a setting with different skills, the skills that affect stress boxes 
and consequences may change. Take a note of those skill benefits when you’re making your character.

- - -

You can add stress tracks if the characters in your game suffer unique kinds of harm, such as 
[wealth stress](#Anchor-132) in a very political game. Changing the number of boxes will slow 
down and draw out conflicts, which may be more appropriate for high-octane, pulpy genres where 
characters are expected to take a lot of hits.

- - -

Landon has Good (+3) Physique, which nets him two more physical stress boxes. His Will, however, 
is only Average (+1), but that’s still good enough for one more mental stress box.

Cynere’s Physique is Fair (+2), so she gets a third physical stress box. But her mental stress 
track remains at two boxes, thanks to her Mediocre (+0) Will.

Zird the Arcane, being a rather bookish type, has Mediocre (+0) Physique, so he has only the 
default physical stress track of two boxes. His Fair (+2) Will, though, is good for one bonus 
mental stress box.

Because none of these characters has Physique or Will rated at Superb (+5) or above, each has 
the default number of consequences: one mild, one moderate, and one severe.

- - -

## You’re All Set!

At the end of this process, you should have a character with:

*   A name
*   Five aspects, along with some backstory
*   One Great, two Good, three Fair, and four Average skills
*   Between three and five stunts
*   A mental and physical stress track of 2–4 boxes each
*   A refresh rate of 1–3 fate points

Now you’re ready to play!

GMs, see the [_Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios_](#SCENES-SESSIONS-AND-SCENARIOS) chapter for advice 
on how to take the aspects from the PCs’ sheets and from game creation and turn those into thrilling 
scenarios for the players to experience.

Players, check out the next chapter for more on how to use your aspects, or jump straight to 
_[Actions and Outcomes](#actions-and-outcomes)_ to learn more about how to use your skills to do 
stuff.

## Quick Character Creation

If you want to skip making a detailed character and just want to play, you can leave most of the 
character blank and fill in as you play.

At minimum, you need to have the following filled out to start:

*   High concept aspect
*   Best skill
*   Name

When it comes to your high concept, you can start off vague and refine the aspect later. Guy with 
Swordis an okay high concept for this method, and later you might discover something about your 
character that puts a spin on it. When that happens, rewrite the aspect to reflect that spin.

You should know your best skill to start—that gives us further ideas about your character. If you 
have any other thoughts on skills, either skills you’re good at or skills you’re bad at, write those 
down. (Since you don’t normally write down any skills you have at lower than Average (+1), just make 
a note on your sheet about those skills you’re intentionally saying you don’t have.)

And, of course, you need a name! Maybe a first name is all you need for the moment, or a nickname. 
(There’s also the trick of giving yourself a name, only to later reveal that you’ve been hiding, are 
undercover, or have amnesia, and write down what your real name is.)

### Starting Play

With this method, you start with 3 refresh, so you’ll start playing with 3 fate points.

After the first session is over, if you’re planning on playing your character again, you should 
take time to fill in the rest of the aspects, skills, and stunts.

### Filling Aspects in Play

Unless you immediately have an idea for your trouble aspect, you’ll fill that in later. With the 
other three aspects, since you’re skipping the Phase Trio, you’ll just make up whatever aspect seems 
interesting to you at the moment. Typically you’ll do this when you need an aspect on your character 
to achieve something, or you want to turn a situation that’s happening into something that’s 
compel-worthy.

As with high concept, don’t stress about getting this aspect dead-on. After the session’s over, 
take some time to look over and tweak the aspects you’ve created on the fly.

### Filling Skills in Play

At any point, if you are using a skill that isn’t on your character sheet, one of two things happens: 
you’ll assume the skill is Mediocre (+0), or you’ll write it down on one of your empty skill slots 
and roll it at that level. This choice exists until all of your skill slots are filled in.

If you roll for a skill not on your sheet and choose to go with Mediocre rather than write it down, 
you can later fill it in on your sheet as something higher. For example, you might be called to roll 
Lore, and choose to roll it at Mediocre. Later, you might be called to roll it again, and this time 
you choose to fill it in at Fair (+2).

Likewise, if you roll well on a skill when you chose to take it at Mediocre, maybe that’ll inspire 
you to take that skill later.

Since some skills have secondary benefits, notably adjusting your stress track and consequences, 
you can fill those in when you want to declare your character has such a benefit. Until then, you 
don’t have those benefits, as you’re assumed to have that skill at Mediocre.

### Filling Stunts in Play

You get three stunts for free, which you can fill in at any time. You can fill in other stunts at 
any time, but you must pay a fate point for each one to do so. That’s because your refresh tells 
you how many fate points you start the game with, so by taking a stunt, you should have started 
with fewer.

If you’re out of fate points, but want to note down a stunt you have because you’re suddenly 
struck with the idea, do so. But your character doesn’t actually have it until you gain a fate 
point and spend it.

You’ll also need to reduce your refresh by one for the next session for each extra stunt you take.
